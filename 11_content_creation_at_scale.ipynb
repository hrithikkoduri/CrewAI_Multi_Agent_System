The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped, dragged by health insurers as U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill seen as crimping their profits. Five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors advanced, led by gains in communication services, technology and consumer discretionary services.

Markets are pricing in more than a 96% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, up from an 86% chance before the data, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Bets had risen following Friday's employment report , which showed an uptick in unemployment alongside a surge in job growth. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 5.2 basis points to 4.271%. \"The equity market seems to be breathing a sigh of relief that this is another steady-as-she-goes report,\" said Wasif Latif, chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners in New Jersey. \"There's no surprises. It seems the equity market was braced for a higher than expected number.\" Item 1 of 2 Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., December 10, 2024.

      "At its December 2024 meeting, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25%, resulting in total rate cuts of 1.00% since September.\n",
      "The FOMC now projects just two interest rate cuts in 2025, compared to earlier projections of four rate cuts. Investors anticipate the Fed may pause interest rate cuts when it meets again in early 2025.\n",
      "For the third consecutive meeting, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds target rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight lending. Following up on September’s 0.50% fed funds target rate cut, and November’s 0.25% cut, the FOMC at its December 2025 meeting cut rates by another 0.25%. The fed funds target rate is now set at 4.25% to 4.50%.\n",
      "The Fed held rates at 5.25% to 5.50% from July 2023 to September 2024. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Fed raised rates eleven times, from near 0%.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Federal Reserve, December 18, 2024.\n",
      "Notably, Fed officials, coming out of December’s meeting, appeared to scale back 2025 rate cut plans. The FOMC now projects just two 2025 rate cuts, compared to earlier projections of four rate cuts. “December’s Fed actions can be read as a hawkish cut,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management. “It sets the market up to be ready for the Fed to go into a pause rather than set the stage for immediate additional rate cuts.”\n",
      "In a statement issued after December’s FOMC meeting, the Fed indicated that current economic data requires a policy balancing act. “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace (2.8% in 2024’s third quarter). 1 Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low (4.2% in November 2024). 2 Inflation has made progress…but remains somewhat elevated (Personal Consumption Expenditures at 2.5% in November 2024),” 1 read the statement. 3 In his own comments, Powell stated that given the Fed’s recently initiated rate cuts, “our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate.” 4\n",
      "Along with the latest interest rate cut, the Fed continues, as it has since 2022, reducing its balance sheet of fixed income assets. At its peak, the Fed’s balance sheet grew to nearly $9 trillion dollars. Each month, the Fed trims its Treasury bond holdings, which now have declined to approximately $6.9 trillion. 5 “It seems unlikely the Fed will drop its balance sheet back to the $4 trillion level, as it stood in 2015-16, but given the extent the economy has grown since then, a larger Fed balance sheet may be justified,” says Haworth.\n",
      "Economy projected to stay on course\n",
      "After December 2024’s meeting, the FOMC issued its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), reflecting each FOMC member’s forward view on key economic variables. The SEP suggests most major economic measures are expected to show little change in 2025. 6\n",

      "“The U.S. economy is just performing very, very well, substantially better than our global peer group,” says Powell. He sees little near-term recession risk. 7\n",
      "“The Fed is seeing a lot of what they want in terms of economic data,” says Haworth. “Inflation in general is slowing, except for recent upticks in food and energy, which are considered transitory. The job market remains healthy as well.”\n",
      "Markets react negatively to Fed policy\n",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s policy statements, equity markets tumbled. Key indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Russell 2000 all showed a one-day loss (on December 18) of 2.5% or more. It appeared to be a negative reaction to the Fed’s scaled-back rate cutting plans.\n",
      "Source: WSJ.com.\n",
      "Bond markets also declined. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped from 4.40% to 4.50% in a single day (bond prices fall when bond yields rise), representing its highest yield since May 2024. 2-year Treasury yields also experienced a similar change, rising from 4.25% to 4.35% .8\n",
      "The Fed’s Balancing Act\n",
      "The Fed’s primary purpose in raising rates and keeping them elevated was to combat the highest inflation since the early 1980s. At its peak, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), reached 9.1% for the 12 months ending in June 2022. The most recent CPI reading, for the 12 months ending in November 2024, showed inflation at a much improved 2.7%.2 However, over the most recent months, inflation moved modestly higher. “There is a risk of a reacceleration of inflation,” says Haworth. “The potential for added tariffs under the new Trump administration could add to that risk.”\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of November 30, 2024.\n",
      "At the same time, says Haworth, “The Fed doesn’t want to see too much softness in the employment market.” That would contribute to a slowing economy. Although the nation’s unemployment rate moved above 4% in mid-2024, it has, in recent months, held steady. 2\n",
      "“December’s Fed actions can be read as a hawkish cut,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management. “It sets the market up to be ready for the Fed to go into a pause rather than set the stage for immediate additional rate cuts.”\n",
      "Haworth notes initial jobless claims provide a helpful “real-time” guide on the state of the jobs market. Claims held steady, but then in early December experienced a sudden uptick. 9\n",
      "Source: U.S. Employment and Training Administration. As of December 7, 2024.\n",
      "Where does the Fed go from here\n",
      "The policymaking FOMC meets next at the end of January 2025. Markets are expecting the Fed to hold the line on rates at that meeting, and possibly at its follow-up meeting in mid-March. 10\n",
      "As the Fed continues to address monetary policy, be sure to consult with your financial professional and review portfolio positioning. Explore whether changes might be appropriate given your goals, time horizon and feelings toward risk in today’s evolving interest rate environment.\n",
      "Frequently asked questions\n",
      "What is monetary policy?\n",
      "Monetary policy is controlled by a nation’s central bank, which in the United States, is the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed’s management of monetary policy can have a significant impact on the shape of the nation’s economy. Congress’ mandate for the Fed is to maintain price stability (manage inflation); promote maximum sustainable employment (low unemployment); and provide for moderate, long-term interest rates. Fed monetary policy influences the cost of many forms of consumer debt such as mortgages, credit cards and automobile loans.\n",
      "What is the Federal Reserve (Fed)?\n",
      "The Fed is the nation’s central bank, and perhaps the most influential financial institution in the world. The central governing board of the Federal Reserve reports to Congress, with the chair of the Federal Reserve appointed by the President. There are also 12 regional federal reserve banks that are set up like private corporations.\n",
      "Why does the Federal Reserve (Fed) raise or lower interest rates?\n",
      "The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target interest rate policy for the federal funds rate. This is the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend excess reserves to other banks on an overnight basis. The fed funds rate is raised or lowered usually to help impact underlying economic conditions. For example, in 2022, as inflation surged, the FOMC began raising interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and slow economic activity. That strategy was designed to ease pricing pressures and reduce the inflation rate. In periods when the economy is slow or in a recession, the Fed tends to lower rates to try to stimulate economic activity and help the economy expand again.\n",

All three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. For the week, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot ( HD ), Cisco ( CSCO ), and Disney ( DIS ) will highlight another week of earnings reports. • USD (^GSPC) Follow View Quote Details Price check In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. \"We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance,\" Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. \"The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. Retail reading The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%. Story Continues Disney on the big screen Disney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter. Streaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms. Shares are up about 9% this year. • USD (DIS) Follow View Quote Details Trump trade lifts Big Tech In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF ( MAGS ) — which tracks Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a \"flight to quality\" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring . Small-cap resurgence Small caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 ( ^RUT ) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years. It closed the week up more than 8% for its best week since April 2020 and is now closing in on its all-time high. This leaves investors with a question that's been prompted throughout 2024 : With the Fed set to keep lowering interest rates, is now the time to pile into small caps? In a Friday webinar, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said not yet. The index has more short-term debt than the S&P 500 and would be a clear beneficiary of lower interest rates. But it also has another key difference from large-cap indexes right now: Earnings estimates aren't rising. While Kantrowitz's research shows 2024 full-year earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have increased over the last 90 days, earnings estimates for the small-cap S&P 600 ( ^SP600 ) index have been falling. \"In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower,\" Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. \"[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet,\" Kantrowitz said. \"So something we'll be monitoring.\" Weekly calendar Monday Economic data: No notable economic releases.

      "### Detailed Summary Report: Impact of US Inflation on the Stock Market in 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overview**  \n",
      "As the Federal Reserve continues to navigate monetary policy in a rapidly changing economic environment, inflation and its implications for the stock market remain a focal point for investors. Recent data indicates that inflation has stabilized, with consumer prices rising at a more modest pace, which has led to significant stock market rallies, particularly in the technology sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Insights**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Response**  \n",
      "   - At its December 2024 meeting, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25%, marking a total of 1.00% in rate cuts since September. The current federal funds target rate stands at 4.25% to 4.50%. These actions are a response to recent inflation data, demonstrating a cautious approach to further rate cuts (U.S. Bank).\n",
      "   - Despite rate cuts, Fed officials have tempered expectations for future cuts, now projecting only two in 2025, suggesting a more conservative outlook driven by stabilizing inflation and healthy labor market conditions (U.S. Bank).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Stock Market Reaction**  \n",
      "   - Following the release of inflation data, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have shown marked increases, with the Nasdaq crossing the 20,000 point milestone for the first time. This rally has been fueled by robust performance in tech stocks, which are expected to benefit further from anticipated cuts to interest rates (Reuters).\n",
      "   - For instance, Tesla shares hit record highs amid speculation around policy changes and reduced regulations under the expected Trump administration, highlighting the interplay between political events and market dynamics (Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inflation Data Analysis**  \n",
      "   - Recent indicators show a consumer price increase of 2.6% year-on-year for October 2024, up from 2.4% in September. This upward trend in inflation reflects supply chain concerns and variability in food and energy prices, which remain key areas of focus for the Fed (Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "   - The improvement in Q4 forecasts has led economists to project economic growth of around 2.5% for 2024, influencing retail sales and consumer behavior positively as the holiday shopping season approaches (Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sector-Specific Impacts**  \n",
      "   - Sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary have seen significant gains due to favorable earnings reports and market sentiment. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's rate cuts tend to favor sectors with higher debt levels, like small-cap stocks, although these have not seen commensurate earnings estimates reflective of this upside potential (Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Market Trends and Predictions**  \n",
      "   - Analysts predict that the combination of decreasing inflation and lower interest rates will continue driving stock market upwards trends into 2025, with expectations that Big Tech will benefit from less regulatory pressure and a sound economic outlook overall (U.S. Bank, Reuters).\n",
      "   - The movement towards retail and consumer services into the holiday season indicates potential for sustained market rallies, conditioned on favorable monthly economic reports in the coming weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implications for Investors**  \n",
      "Investors should closely monitor the evolving landscape of inflation data as well as the Federal Reserve's response. Positioning in growth sectors, particularly technology, may yield favorable returns as interest rates remain low. Caution is advised in sectors where earnings are not showing commensurate growth, as volatility may persist leading into the new fiscal year.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**  \n",
      "As 2024 progresses, the interplay between inflation control measures and market dynamics will be pivotal in shaping investor strategies. Ongoing economic indicators, particularly regarding inflation and employment, will remain essential for navigating this landscape effectively. \n",

      "### Detailed Analysis Report: Impact of US Inflation on the Stock Market in 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overview**  \n",
      "The ongoing dynamics of inflation and Federal Reserve policy continue to influence the US stock market as we progress into 2024. Recent trends suggest a moderation in inflation rates, with implications for investor sentiment and market performance. This report consolidates key insights from current data, analyzes sector-specific impacts, and provides actionable recommendations for strategic content creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Insights**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Response**  \n",
      "   - At its December 2024 meeting, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25%, totaling 1.00% in cuts since September, citing better-than-expected inflation reports. As a result, the federal funds rate now stands at 4.25% to 4.50%. This cautious yet reactive stance indicates that the Fed is balancing the need for economic growth with inflation control (U.S. Bank). \n",
      "   - Rate cut projections for 2025 have been reduced, showing a shift to a more conservative policy approach amidst stabilizing inflation and a resilient labor market (U.S. Bank).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Performance of the Stock Market**  \n",
      "   - In the aftermath of favorable inflation data, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices have experienced significant rallies, with the latter surpassing the 20,000-point threshold. Particularly, tech stocks like Tesla have reached record highs, largely driven by investor optimism surrounding both economic policy changes and lower borrowing costs (Reuters, Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "   - Overall, the increase in the Nasdaq by more than 31% over the past year underlines the strong recovery and growth potential, particularly in technology and consumer discretionary sectors (Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inflation Data Analysis**  \n",
      "   - The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US showed a year-on-year increase of 2.6% for October 2024, which slightly up from 2.4% in September, driven by rising food and energy prices. This uptick reflects ongoing supply chain challenges and highlights food and energy prices as critical areas of concern for the Fed (Yahoo Finance). \n",
      "   - Economic growth for 2024 is projected at about 2.5%, bolstered by improved consumer spending in anticipation of the holiday season, suggesting potential boosts in retail performance (Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sector-Specific Impacts**  \n",
      "   - Growth sectors, notably technology, have yielded promising earnings, with expectations that reduced interest rates will facilitate further investment in high-debt areas. Small-cap stocks, although showing an uptick, may not yet reflect the full earnings potential relative to the boost from lower rates (Yahoo Finance).\n",
      "   - Furthermore, as inflation stabilizes, sectors tied to discretionary spending and e-commerce are likely to continue flourishing, presenting growth opportunities amid favorable economic conditions (BlackRock).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Market Trends and Predictions**  \n",
      "   - Analysts expect continuing trends of decreasing inflation and reducing interest rates to propel stock market growth into 2025. The conjectured focus on major tech firms indicates that these entities will benefit most from reduced regulatory pressures and positive market sentiment (U.S. Bank, Reuters).\n",
      "   - The upcoming holiday retail season could sustain upward market momentum, provided that forthcoming monthly economic reports remain favorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implications for Investors**  \n",
      "Investors are urged to continuously monitor inflation trends and Fed policy responses. Stocks in growth areas, particularly technology and consumer discretionary sectors, should be prioritized for investment. Greater caution is advisable for sectors where earnings do not align with current valuations as market volatility may rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**  \n",
      "The interplay between inflation management and stock market growth in 2024 will be critical in shaping investment strategies. Stakeholders must remain vigilant with respect to evolving economic indicators, particularly in terms of inflation and labor market conditions, that could have implications for market conditions heading into 2025.\n",

      "  \"article\": \"# Understanding US Inflation and Its Impact on the Stock Market in 2024\\n\\n## Introduction\\nAs we move closer to 2024, understanding inflation's profound impact on the stock market has never been more crucial for investors. Inflation, which refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, affects not just consumer purchasing power but also corporate profitability and investment strategies. This article explores the current landscape of inflation in the United States and offers insights into how it may influence stock market performance in the coming year.\\n\\n## Current State of Inflation in the US\\nThe US has witnessed fluctuating inflation rates throughout 2023 as the economy adjusts to post-pandemic realities. The Federal Reserve's actions, including interest rate hikes, aim to stabilize prices, but inflation continues to linger above the desired 2% target. Key factors contributing to this inflation include supply chain disruptions, increased demand for goods and services, and elevated energy prices. Understanding these components is essential for predicting how stock markets will react as we enter 2024.\\n\\nMoreover, inflation variations have direct implications for different sectors within the stock market. Consumer discretionary sectors often struggle with rising costs, while sectors like energy or utilities may benefit. Keeping an eye on these developments can help investors position their portfolios accordingly.\\n\\n## The Stock Market Response to Inflation\\nHistorically, rising inflation has led to increased volatility in equity markets. Typically, investors react to inflationary pressures by reallocating resources away from growth stocks, which are susceptible to increased costs, towards defensive stocks that promise stability. As we analyze trends heading into 2024, we expect this shift to continue.\\n\\nAnalysts predict that sectors such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples might outperform during inflationary periods, as their products remain in demand regardless of rising prices.
