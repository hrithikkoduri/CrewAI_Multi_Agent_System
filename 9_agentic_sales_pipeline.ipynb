      "“I worked with Ryan for 3ish years, during which he executed on complex M&A, managed several concurrent products, and moved the needle in directions that no one could do otherwise. Ryan excels as a product manager who is helpful and empathetic to his stakeholders, and he was a pivotal leader for multi-million $ products that have been critical to LiveRamp's success. He can talk tech with eng, pull together complicated market analyses, and do it all with his amazing work ethic. I'd recommend Ryan for any job out there and I hope we'll cross paths again.\n",

      "“Ryan came to Tesla as a summer intern in 2015, and made an immediate impression on me and others that he worked with. This was based on his excellent and friendly attitude, attention to detail, and good instincts. My strongest memories of Ryan were asking him to perform tasks, and finding that he was already well on his way to completing them. Ryan is also the kind of team player who doesn’t have to be to be told, or taught, twice. He immediately absorbs complex information, asking pertinent questions.\n",
      "Once Ryan came up to speed on our team’s work and priorities, he was quickly able to start tackling work independently. He communicates his thoughts, questions, and the status of his work clearly and concisely. He understood the big picture for our team’s projects, knowing where his contributions fit as part of the whole. In addition to his technical contributions, Ryan was a real pleasure to work with. He is honest, reliable, and clearly excited about his work. We felt his contributions were valuable enough that we asked Ryan to work with us well past the date his original internship was scheduled to end. I hope I’ll have a chance to work with him again in the future. \n",

      "- **Deep Sync:** Focuses on data-driven technology, teamwork, and employee development. They aim to foster an environment with low pressure and opportunities for upskilling.  \n",
      "- **CrewAI:** Values innovation, employee engagement, and the development of AI solutions that facilitate automation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategic Alignment:**  \n",
      "- **Deep Sync's Mission:** Powers agencies and brands with data technologies that enhance marketing and audience insights. This aligns well with CrewAI's focus on providing an orchestration platform for AI agents.  \n",
      "- **Goals and Objectives:** Both companies aim to enhance productivity through the use of technology, but with distinct focal points—CrewAI is more concentrated on agentic automation while Deep Sync enriches data-driven marketing.  \n",

      "**Qualitative Scoring:**  \n",
      "- **Cultural Fit Score:** 7/10  \n",
      "  - Reasoning: The companies share a common goal in leveraging technology to optimize business processes, but the methodologies and areas of focus differ. While Deep Sync seems to have a positive internal culture, it might not possess the same level of innovation focus that CrewAI champions.  \n",

      "**Comments:**  \n",
      "- Overall, Deep Sync exhibits a culture that is supportive and conducive to employee growth, which is a good sign for a partnership. However, differing emphases on automation versus data analysis may require strategies to align team dynamics and objectives further.  \n",
